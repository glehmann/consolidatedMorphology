The mathematical morphology operations of erosion, dilation, opening
and closing are members of an important family of non-linear which
compute rank statistics of a kernel. Direct implementation of these
filters lead to slow implementations with complexity proportional to
kernel size. A number of algorithms are available that provide much
improved performance for certain important classes of kernels.
We have implemented several algorithms, studied
their performance in different conditions, and shown that all of them are more 
efficients than the others in certain conditions.

We have introduced a new structuring element class and a meta filter
that integrates the new algorithms with those available in the
toolkit. The meta filter attempts to select the best algorithm
depending on the image and structuring element.

The other parts will come later. Be aware that other classes than FlatStructuringElement
are still in development and may produce incorrect results.}

\section{Introduction}
An erosion operation may be loosely defined as replacing the origin of
a kernel by the minimum value in the region defined by the kernel. The
ITK erosion filter, {\em GrayscaleErodeImageFilter}, performs this
operation directly using a neighborhood iterator. While this is quite
a neat example of the use of neighborhood iterators and boundary
conditions, it the worst possible way of implementing an erosion,
resulting in a complexity proportional to the number of pixels in the
kernel. This complexity is especially significant when dealing with
large structuring elements and tends to limit the applicability of
these otherwise very useful filters.

This paper will describe two classes of technique that dramatically
improve the performance of these operations. One technique is
applicable to arbitrary shaped structuring elements and reduces the
complexity from $O(n^d)$ to $O(n^{d-1})$, where $n$ is the kernel size
and $d$ is the kernel dimension. The other is applicable to only
certain shapes of structuring element and produce a complexity that is
{\bf independent} of kernel size. Two algorithms implementing the
latter approach have been included.

\section{Flat vs non-flat structuring elements}
Morphological operations may involve flat or non-flat structuring
elements. Non-flat structuring elements are less commonly used than
flat, and are analogous to a weighted kernel. This discussion will
focus on flat structuring elements, although technique described in
Section \ref{sect:movingHist} is applicable to non-flat structuring
elements.

\section{General background}
There are, broadly speaking, two approaches to speeding up kernel
based filters. The first is to exploit properties such as
separability, which may allow an n-dimensional filter to be
implemented as several one dimensional filters. When this sort of
decomposition is possible complexity is typically reduced from
$O(n^d)$ to $O(nd)$. The second approach is to exploit redundancy in
the computation to produce a recursive implementation of the filter,
meaning that the result for a pixel becomes dependent on the result
for neighboring pixel. In the best case scenario the complexity may
become independent of kernel size.

The gaussian convolution filters in ITK exploit both approaches.

\section{Arbitary structuring elements}
\label{sect:movingHist}
The technique used to implement morhpological operations by arbitary
structuring is based on a updatable histogram and was described in
\cite{Vandroogenbroeck96.3}. The basic concept is very simple.
A histogram is computed for the kernel centred on the first pixel of
the image. The maximum or minimum pixel value can easily be computed
using the histogram. The histogram for the neighboring pixel can be
computed by discarding outgoing pixels and adding incoming
pixels. Outgoing and incoming pixels for a particular kernel can be
automatically computed when the kernel is created.

This is an example of a recursive implementation.

\subsection{Differences between this implementation and original paper}
The original paper restricted the pixel type to 8 bit so that a 256
element histogram could be used. This implementation uses a C++ map
for larger pixel types and a fixed size type for 8 and 16 bit pixels.

The original paper also advocated sliding the kernel in a zigzag
pattern through the image. Our experiments showed that sliding the
kernel in raster order, which required saving the histogram between
lines, offered a performance advantage (approximately 15\%) for large
images. This is presumably related to cache activity.

\section{Decomposable structuring elements}
A variety of useful structuring element shapes can be composed from
line segments. The classical example is a rectangle - an erosion by a
$n \times m$ rectangle can be produced by carrying out an erosion by a
horizontal line of length $n$ followed by an erosion by a vertical
line of length $m$. Circles, or at least useful approximations of
circles, can be produced using a radial decomposition
\cite{Adams93}. Useful approximations of spheres, based on platonic
solids and other shapes, can also be constructed this way.

The ability to decompose structuring elements into line operations is
especially significant because there are a number of very fast,
recursive, algorithms for erosions and dilations that have complexity
that is independent of line length. The most famous of these are
probably \cite{vanHerk1992a,Gil1993}, which require approximately 3
operations per pixel. A more recent advance, using {\em anchors}
\cite{Vandroogenbroeck2005Morphological} reduces this
further\footnote{This discussion is very brief. More details of
existing algorithms are available in
\cite{Vandroogenbroeck2005Morphological}}. Both algorithms have been
implemented in the new class hierarchy.

The implementation of anchor based morphology extends the algorithm
described in \cite{Vandroogenbroeck2005Morphological} to support
arbitary pixel types. Lines at arbitary angles are also supported
using the techniques described in \cite{soille-breen-jones96}.

\section{The new class heirarchy}
Several classes can currently be used as structuring element in ITK: \doxygen{Neighborhood}
and some subclass of \doxygen{Neighborhood}. There is several problems with that:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Some class like \doxygen{BinaryBallStructuringElement}
contains some code to generate a structuring element of particular shape
(a ball in that case), but the required call to the method \verb$CreateStructuringElement()$
make it particulary confusing for the beginner
  \item \verb$TPixel$, the first template parameter
of the \doxygen{Neighborhood} class and its subclass is meaning less in that case. It
can be safely set to a different type than the pixel type of the image, and store
only a binary information: inside the neighborhood or outside the neighborhood.
  \item ITK doesn't offer convenient code to visualize the structuring element,
or generate a structuring element from an image
\end{itemize}

The \doxygen{FlatStructuringElement} class provided with this article aims to solve those
problems, and, with the meta filters, to make the integration of the van Herk
/ Gil Werman and Anchor algorithms as transparent as possible.

 \subsection{FlatStructuringElement}

The FlatStructuringElement is implemented as a subclass of \doxygen{Neighborhood}, in order to
keep backward compatibility. However, only the \verb$VDimension$ template parameter has
been kept. The meaning less \verb$TPixel$ of the \doxygen{Neighborhood} class is set to
\verb$bool$ and hidden to the user.

\doxygen{FlatStructuringElement} provides several static methods. Each of them let the user
produce a stucturing element with a given shape:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb$Ball()$ generate a ball structuring element. It takes the radius of the structuring
element as parameter.
  \item \verb$Box()$ produce a box structuring element. It takes the radius of the structuring
element as parameter.
  \item \verb$FromImage()$ produce a structuring element from an image. The image is passed
as parameter to the method. A optional parameter can also be passed: the pixel value
to be considered as the foreground value in the image. This value defaults to
\verb$NumericTraits< PixelType >::max()$.
\end{itemize}

The number of available shapes is currently limited. However, the most useful
ones are there, and the ability to generate a structuring element from an
image should let the user easily create the ones he may need.
Also, the infrastructure is there and other methods to generate others shape
can be easily added.

The \verb$GetImage()$ method in \doxygen{FlatStructuringElement} class let the user generate
an image from its structuring element, and thus easily visualize its real
shape. \verb$GetImage()$ is templated over the image type to produce. By default,
the pixels outside the structuring element are set to \verb$NumericTraits< PixelType >::Zero$,
and the pixels inside the structuring element to \verb$NumericTraits< PixelType >::max()$.

The method \verb$GetImage()$ and \verb$FromImage()$ are templated methods. This particularity
make them not available when wrapped in \verb$Python$, \verb$Tcl$ or \verb$Java$. For this usage,
\verb$GetImageUC()$ and \verb$FromImageUC()$ has been created. They provide the same fonctionality
that \verb$GetImage()$ and \verb$FromImage()$, but are limited to the pixel type \verb$unsigned char$, so
they can be not templated. This methods are only there to be used with wrappers
and shouldn't be used in \verb$C++$.
